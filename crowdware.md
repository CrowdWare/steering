# CrowdWare

## Project States
### Inception Phase
Goal: Define the projectâ€™s fundamental vision and business value.
- Identify key requirements and stakeholders
- Estimate project scope, budget, and timeline
- Conduct initial architectural considerations (but no detailed design yet)
- Assess risks and plan for the next phase
- Decide whether the project should continue (Go/No-Go decision)
Outcome: A rough project vision, initial use cases, a high-level architectural concept, and a project plan.
    
### Elaboration Phase
Goal: Develop a stable architecture and refine the requirements.
- Detailed analysis of functional and non-functional requirements
- Development of a working architectural prototype
- First implementation of core functionalities
- Creation of a detailed project plan with realistic effort and timeline estimates
- Identification and reduction of major project risks
Outcome: A solid architecture blueprint, refined requirements, an initial working version, and a detailed project plan.
    
### Pre CrowdFunding
Goal: Collect companies with similar needs

### CrowdFunding
Goal: Collect the development costs and ofc the costs from inception and elaboration phase.

### Construction Phase
Goal: Develop and implement the complete system, here we will switch to agile development like scrum.
- Iterative software development based on the defined architecture
- Implementation of all functional requirements
- Execution of unit tests, integration tests, and initial system tests
- Preparation of user manuals and documentation
- Possible alpha or beta releases for test groups
Outcome: A fully implemented system with a tested architecture and documentation.

 ### Transition Phase
Goal: Deploy the product to end users.
- Integration of the system into the production environment
- Execution of user acceptance tests
- User training and onboarding
- Bug fixes and final optimizations based on user feedback
- Handover to operations and maintenance teams
Outcome: A production-ready system with training materials, documentation, and support structures.

### Selling commercial licenses
Goal: We create open source software which all people may use for free of charge, but if they make money with it, we also charge for commercial licenses. 
Outcome: The whole team who worked on that project gets a split, based on the time they invest and also based on their hourly rate. A part of the benefits will be put in the pools. 
These pools are for risk capital and capital to spend for community building and the like.
